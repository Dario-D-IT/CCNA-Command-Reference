01 - VLANs & Trunking (802.1Q)

**Concept:** VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) allow  logical segmentation of a physical switch into multiple broadcast domains, improving security, performance, and manageability.
A BROADCAST DOMAIN is the group of devices which will receive a BROADCAST FRAME (Destination MAC : FFFF.FFFF.FFFF) sent by any one of the members.
